## Map of British Museum objects in Sloane Lab Knowledge Base

This map displays places that occur in the [Sloane Lab knowledge base](https://knowledgebase.sloanelab.org/resource/Start). The majority of the places relate to objects in the British Museum and each object’s symbol allows the user to click through a related web page. The places existed in the objects’ catalogue records or were extracted from text in those catalogue records through an automated computational process. The map is not representative of the entirety of Hans Sloane's collections and is not intended to provide a visual summary of the collection’s geography. For example, the dense distribution in Europe is likely due to the choice to focus specifically on objects from the British Museum alongside biases in cataloguing or algorithmic selection. The intention in creating the map was to present users with places that they might not otherwise find and to prompt them to click and discover more information. Many of these objects entered the collection through the work of individuals who were enslaved, coerced, or unremunerated for their efforts.
